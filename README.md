HIDE - cross platform IDE for Haxe programming language

Thanks to a group of [crowd funders at IndieGoGo](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cactus-ide/), HIDE is open source, licensed under the terms of the MIT License.

### History
Project was actively developed for almost a year by @as3boyan. (Summer 2013 - Summer 2014).
It's pretty huge project, and there is not much IDEs made purely on web technologies.
@misterpah gave this project great starting boost with making starting menu and choosing Bootstrap framework as main framework for GUI. After that it was maintained mostly by @as3boyan. @misterpah decided to develop it's own IDE for Haxe, named Haxe Studio.

@NickHolder did amazing job on outline panel(types, scope of functions and variables, sorting).

### Architecture controversy
At start @as3boyan and @misterpah worked on one branch(master).
@as3boyan and @misterpah argued a lot on plugin system implementation(which was requirement from Haxe Foundation).
@as3boyan and @misterpah implemented their own plugin systems.
Then @as3boyan decided to integrate everything into the core. @misterpah didn't agreed with this decision.
Anyway, they both worked on different branches.

>Most IDEs integrate basic functionality to the core, for performance and stability reasons. And having lots of plugins, makes it harder to manage dependencies.


### Project funding
$2,740USD(including 7% fees) were equally split between two developers: @as3boyan and @misterpah.

1. Run following commands:

```bash
#Clone source using git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HaxeIDE/HIDE.git

#Haxe 3 is required. Install haxelibs
haxelib install jQueryExtern
haxelib install tjson
haxelib install node-webkit

#Navigate to the root directory
